                <h4>Agatha Christie is one of the most popular writers in history. Almost four billion copies of her novels have been sold across the globe, and her book sales are beaten only by William Shakespeare. Here, we take a look at the life of the best-selling author, whose novels include some of the most recognisable characters in British literature, including Poirot and Miss Marple.</h4>
                <p><h3><b>When was Agatha Christie born?</b></h3></p>
                <p>15 September 1890, Torquay, Devon</p>
                <p><h3><b>When did she die?</b></h3></p>
                <p>12 January 1976, Wallingford, Oxfordshire</p>
                <p><h3><b>What is she remembered for?</b></h3></p>
                <p>Being one of the best-selling authors in history, Agatha Christie’s crime novels have produced some of the most recognisable characters in British literature, including Poirot and Miss Marple.In 1971 Christie was presented with a damehood by Queen Elizabeth II for her services to literature.</p>
                <p><h3><b>How did she become an author?</b></h3></p>
                <p>Growing up in Devon during the last decade of the 19th century, Agatha taught herself to read by the age of five. While her two siblings were sent away for their education, Agatha was homeschooled by her parents, and from a young age she enjoyed reading, writing poetry and playing music.</p>
                <p>In 1902 Agatha began her formal education at Miss Guyer’s Girls’ School in Torquay, before moving to France in 1905 to continue her education at three different Parisian schools.</p>
                <p>After moving back to England in 1910, Agatha began writing her first short story, <i>The House of Dreams</i>. Not until 1926 was the tale published, in an issue of <i>The Sovereign Magazine</i>.</p>
                <p><h3><b>When did she begin writing detective stories and crime novels?</b></h3></p>
                <p>It was during the First World War that Agatha began writing detective stories. Her first novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i>, was written in 1916, but was not published until four years later.</p>
                <p>After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Agatha volunteered at the pharmacy of the University College Hospital in London. There she learned about different poisons and medicines, and she used this newfound knowledge in her later crime novels</p>
                <p>Agatha continued to write after the Second World War, and was awarded a CBE  (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1956 New Year Honours list for her contribution to literature. Her husband was presented with a knighthood in 1968 for his archaeological work, and Agatha was promoted to Dame Commander in 1971.</p>
                <p><h3><b>How did she die?</b></h3></p>
                <p>Agatha’s health began to decline during the 1970s, and on 12 January 1976 she died from natural causes at her home in Oxfordshire. Agatha’s final novel, <i>Sleeping Murder: Miss Marple’s Last Case</i>, was published posthumously in October 1976.</p>
